/**
 * <H1>A Blocking Map</H1> Blocking map is a Map that additionally supports
 * operations that wait for a key to be available when retrieving an element.
 * Blocking map acts as a synchronizer between producers and consumers.
 *
 * <p> BlockingMap methods come in three forms, with different ways of handling
 * operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at some
 * point in the future: one returns a special value, the second blocks the
 * current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and the third
 * blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving up. These methods
 * are summarized in the following table:
 *
 * <p> <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1> <tr> <td></td> <td
 * ALIGN=CENTER><em>Special value</em></td> <td
 * ALIGN=CENTER><em>Blocks</em></td> <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Times out</em></td>
 * </tr> <tr> <td><b>Insert</b></td> <td>{@link #put put(key, value)}</td> <td>{@link #offer offer(key, value)}</td> <td>{@link #offer(Object, Object, long, TimeUnit) offer(key, value, time, unit)}</td>
 * </tr> <tr> <td><b>Remove</b></td> <td>{@link #remove remove(key)}</td> <td>{@link #take take(key)}</td> <td>{@link #take(Object, long, TimeUnit) take(key, time, unit)}</td>
 * </tr> <tr> <td><b>Examine</b></td> <td>{@link #get get()}</td> <td><em>not
 * applicable</em></td> <td><em>not applicable</em></td> </tr> </table>
 *
 * <p> A BlockingMap does not accept null elements. Implementations throw
 * NullPointerException on attempts to put or offer a null. A null is used as a
 * sentinel value to indicate failure of get & take operations.
 *
 * <p> A BlockingMap may be capacity bounded. At any given time it may have a
 * remainingCapacity beyond which no additional elements can be put without
 * blocking. A BlockingQueue without any intrinsic capacity constraints always
 * reports a remaining capacity of Integer.MAX_VALUE.
 *
 * <p> BlockingMap implementations are designed to be used primarily for
 * producer-consumer queues, but additionally support the Collection interface.
 * So, for example, it is possible to put a group of key-value pairs to a map
 * using putAll(map). However, such operations are in general not performed very
 * efficiently, and are intended for only occasional use.
 *
 * <p> BlockingMap implementations are thread-safe. All queuing methods achieve
 * their effects atomically using internal locks or other forms of concurrency
 * control. However, the bulk Collection operations addAll, containsAll,
 * retainAll and removeAll are not necessarily performed atomically unless
 * specified otherwise in an implementation. So it is possible, for example, for
 * putAll(map) to fail (throwing an exception) after adding only some of the
 * elements in map.
 *
 * <p> A BlockingMap does not intrinsically support any kind of "close" or
 * "shutdown" operation to indicate that no more items will be added. The needs
 * and usage of such features tend to be implementation-dependent. For example,
 * a common tactic is for producers to insert special end-of-stream or poison
 * objects, that are interpreted accordingly when taken by consumers.
 *
 * <p> BlockingMap implementations generally do not define element-based
 * versions of methods equals and hashCode but instead inherit the identity
 * based versions from class Object, because element-based equality is not
 * always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different ordering
 * properties.
 *
 *
 * <p> Producers cannot
 * <code>put(key, value)/offer(key, value)</code> on a key that is already
 * available on the map. Attempts to put a mapping whose key is already
 * available on the map are ignored. However, the same mapping can be put in to
 * the map after it is taken by consumer(s)
 *
 *
 * Usage example, based on a typical producer-consumer scenario. Note that a
 * BlockingMap can safely be used with multiple producers and multiple
 * consumers.
