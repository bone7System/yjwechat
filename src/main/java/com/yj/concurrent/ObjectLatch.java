/**
 * <H1>A Blocking Object Latch</H1> This class implements a blocking object
 * latch, that acts as a synchronizer between a producer of an object and it's
 * consumer(s). <p> An object is set with
 * <code>set()</code>only ONCE. Further attempts to set the object are just
 * ignored.<br> Consumers request the object with
 * <code>get()</code>. If the object is not already set, consumers are blocked
 * waiting until the object is available or until an interrupt
 * (InteruptedException) terminates the wait. The map can be tested for object
 * availability with isAvailable(), which answers true if the object has already
 * been set. <br>
