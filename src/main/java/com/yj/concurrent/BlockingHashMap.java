/**
 * An unbound {@linkplain BlockingMap blocking map} backed by a hashmap that is
 * concurrent. This map offers no guarantee on the order of retrieval.
 *
 * <p>This is similar to &quot;unbounded buffer&quot;, in which the synchronizer
 * elements inserted by producers and extracted by consumers. The only twist is
 * that each product has a key & consumers know which product they are
 * interested in. Attempts to <tt>put/offer</tt> an element into the map will
 * always succeed because this is an unbound map; attempts to <tt>take</tt>
 * element corresponding to a key that is not available on the map will block.
 *
 *
 * <p> This map can be shutdown using <tt>clear</tt>. All consumers blocked on
 * the map while invoking clear will be throw <tt>InterruptedException</tt> or
 * return with <tt>null</tt>. Attempting any operation after shutdown will throw
 * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
 *
 * <p>This class implements some of <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map}.
