/**
 * This class represents a BlockingHashMap that is active & functional.
 * BlockingHashMap delegates all operations to this map
 *
 * Explicit read & write locks used to improve throughput read locks can
 * interleave but write locks or read & write locks cannot interleave write lock
 * on take prevents more than one consumer from taking at the same time It also
 * prevents any producer from offering when a take is in progress This will
 * degrade over-all thru put of the map
 *
 * Conflicts & ambiguities arise only when operations on the same key interleave
 * Therefore, there should be explicit lock for each key This approach will
 * yield maximum throughput This will be implemented in the next version
